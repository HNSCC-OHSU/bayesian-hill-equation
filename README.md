# Bayesian Regression using the Hill Equation 

Simple implementation of the hill equation in a bayesian regression framework. Allows for placement of priors on variables as well as propagation of uncertainty onto the summary metrics like IC50. 

We believe this method is especially valuable in low data scenarios, or when there is poor concordance between replicates. 

See the [tutorial](./tutorial.ipynb) for example on how to use this code.
